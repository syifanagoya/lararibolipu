Lil Peep rose to fame as a member of the emo rap collective GothBoiClique. Considered a leading figure in the emo rap scene in the 2010s, he released such works as the mixtapes "Crybaby" and "Hellboy," the EP "Goth Angel Sinner," and the two-part studio album "Come Over When You're Sober." Lil Peep passed away on November 15, 2017 at 21 years old from a Fentanyl-Xanax accidental overdose.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Lil Peep, whose real name was Gustav Elijah Åhr, was born on November 1, 1996 in Allentown, Pennsylvania as the second child of first-grade teacher Liza Womack and history professor Johan Åhr. Johan earned an Bachelors degree in Modern European History at Harvard then got his doctorate at Yale. He eventually ended up teaching at Hofstra in Hempstead, New York.</p><p>Lil Peep grew up not far from Hofstra in Long Beach, New York. His parents separated when he was 15, around which time he began self-medicating for his anxiety with Xanax and marijuana. He was educated at Lindell Elementary School and Long Beach High School, graduating from the latter in 2014. He subsequently enrolled as an out of state student at Glendale Community College in California; however, he dropped out after one semester and enrolled at Nassau Community College on Long Island. Åhr ultimately dropped out of that school, as well, in order to pursue his music career.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>While living on Long Island, Åhr created music using the stage name Trap Goose. After dropping out of college, he moved to Los Angeles and adopted the stage name Lil Peep. In 2015, he released his first EP, "Feelz." Peep followed that with his debut mixtape, "Lil Peep; Part One," and a second mixtape, "Live Forever." Initially living in LA without a home on Skid Row, Peep eventually found lodging with his childhood friend Brennan Savage, and later with rappers JGRXXN and Craig Xen. Together, the three formed the group Schemaposse.</p><h2 id=crybaby-hellboy><strong>Crybaby and Hellboy</strong></h2><p>After the breakup of Schemaposse, Peep joined the emo rap collective GothBoiClique. Some of the group's members were featured on his 2016 mixtape "Crybaby," which was released on SoundCloud. The mixtape was well-received both commercially and critically. Later in 2016, Peep released what would be his final solo mixtape, "Hellboy." His greatest commercial success yet, it spawned such viral songs as "Girls" and "OMFG," which racked up millions of plays on SoundCloud and YouTube. The success of "Hellboy" precipitated Peep's first solo tour of the US and Europe.</p><h2 id=come-over-when-you8217re-sober><strong>Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1</strong></h2><p>Following the end of his tour, Peep moved to London, England, where he began associating with rapper iLoveMakonnen. There, he recorded his debut studio album, "Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1." Released in August of 2017, it was supported by the singles "Awful Things," "Benz Truck," "Save That Shit," and "The Brightside." Following the release, Peep embarked on a world tour.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-251771 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lil-Peep.jpg alt="Lil Peep net worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-251771 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=posthumous-releases><strong>Posthumous Releases</strong></h2><p>Peep's popularity grew significantly after his passing, bolstered by a number of posthumous releases of songs and projects he had completed prior to his death. The first official posthumous release was the video for his unreleased song "16 Lines." Next came the releases of the songs "Spotlight," a collaboration with Marshmello; "Got 'Em Like," a collaboration with <a href=# title="Juicy J Net Worth">Juicy J</a> and <a href=# title="Wiz Khalifa Net Worth">Wiz Khalifa</a>; and "Dreams & Nightmares," a collaboration with Teddy. Many other further works were posthumously released throughout 2018, including the singles "4 Gold Chains," "Sunlight on Your Skin," and "Falling Down" and the studio album "Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2." The album was hugely successful, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200.</p><p>In early 2019, the single "I've Been Waiting" was released; it was the first single from the upcoming collaborative album with iLoveMakonnen. Later that year, Peep's EP "Goth Angel Sinner" was released. Over the subsequent years, many of his mixtapes and EPs were rereleased by his estate. Also released were two previously unreleased EPs, "Friends" and "High Fashion," which were collaborations with Yunggoth and Harry Fraud, respectively. Both came out in late 2021.</p><h2 id=personal-life-death><strong>Personal Life and Death</strong></h2><p>Peep came out as bisexual via a Twitter post in 2017. Around that time, he started dating actress and singer <a href=# title="Bella Thorne Net Worth">Bella Thorne</a>. After they broke up, Peep began a relationship with Arzaylea Rodriguez.</p><p>Throughout his life, Peep openly discussed his battles with depression, anxiety, and drug use, as well as his suicidal thoughts. While on tour in Tucson, Arizona in November of 2017, he was found dead on his tour bus of an accidental overdose of fentanyl and Xanax. Toxicology tests also found cannabis, cocaine, Tramadol, and a number of powerful opioids in his system.</p><h2 id=legacy><strong>Legacy</strong></h2><p>Prior to his passing, Peep had built a devoted fan base of people who related to his struggles with depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. He was considered by many to be a leading figure in both the hip hop and emo youth subcultures that were becoming prominent online. Since his death, Peep has been integral in reviving the emo scene. In 2019, he was the subject of the documentary film "Everybody's Everything," directed by Sebastian Jones and Ramez Silyan. A compilation album of the same name was released alongside the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6G2rXnPnpypZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichest-celebrities.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ashley-stclair-age-husband-wikipedia-biography-is-she-married-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ashley-stclair-age-husband-wikipedia-biography-is-she-married-html.html>Ashley StClair Age, Husband, Wikipedia, Biography: Is She Married?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./154194-money-brain-man-destroys-lamborghini-urus-worth-n115-million-video-viral.html>Rich Man Destroys Brand New Lamborghini Urus Worth R4.5 Million in Viral Instagram Video</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./154194-money-brain-man-destroys-lamborghini-urus-worth-n115-million-video-viral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
