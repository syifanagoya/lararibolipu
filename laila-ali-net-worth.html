A short time after the Chornobyl nuclear tragedy, his father, who was one of the commanders assigned with the cleanup, received a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Klitschko worked as a toolmaker at the Kyiv Automation Plant as a young man to help pay the expenses. Years later, he was alleged to have worked as a debt collector for a mafia lord in the 1990s, an accusation that Vitali has strongly rejected.</p><p>Vitali’s brother <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/wladimir-klitschko-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=123238 data-wpel-link=internal>Wladimir Klitschko</a> is also a heavyweight boxer and has managed to dominate the sport with his brother.</p><p>Because of the nature of their father’s work, they had to relocate regularly to other nations and Soviet republics. He ended up attending multiple schools as a result and served in the military in Uman, a Soviet Air Force base, from 1989 until 1991.</p><p>Klitschko began boxing in the 1980s, and Anatoliy Klimanov, a former Soviet fighter, served as his primary trainer.</p><p>However, when the Soviet Union decided to no longer outlaw the sport, Vitali soon picked up kickboxing.</p><p>He competed and trained in kickboxing, karate, and boxing throughout these formative years, displaying potential in all three sports.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After winning his first 24 fights via knockout or technical knockout, Vitali earned a reputation as a terrifying opponent, not unlike <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/mike-tyson-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=123239 data-wpel-link=internal>Mike Tyson</a> in his prime.</p><p>He defeated Herbie Hide in the second round of their fight to claim the WBO heavyweight championship in 1999.</p><p>He then made two title defenses but fell to Chris Byrd in 2000, primarily due to Vitali’s severe shoulder injury, which resulted in a stoppage.</p><p>Klitschko was in the lead when the fight was stopped, according to the scorecards, and he then faced harsh criticism for ending the fight.</p><p>After 5 straight victories, Klitschko proved that he deserved a chance to challenge <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/lennox-lewis-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=123240 data-wpel-link=internal>Lennox Lewis</a> for the WBC championship.</p><p>Despite being the underdog, Vitali startled Lewis with a series of powerful blows, but Klitschko received a cut over his left eye, causing the referee to once more stop the fight due to an injury.</p><p>When the fight was called off, Klitschko once more had the advantage on the scorecards but failed to secure a victory.</p><p>Willing to fight Lewis again, Vitali put in a valiant effort to do so, but Lewis relinquished the championship when he retired in 2004.</p><p>Ultimately, Klitschko went on to defeat the South African heavyweight champion, Corrie Sanders, to claim the WBC championship and prove he was the best.</p><p>After a successful medical procedure to fix his ACL ligament, Klitschko made a comeback in 2008 to challenge Samuel Peter for the heavyweight championship.</p><p>After that, he successfully defended his championship against a variety of opponents up until 2013, when he decided to quit and concentrate on his political career.</p><p>Klitschko joins <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/larry-holmes-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=123241 data-wpel-link=internal>Larry Holmes</a>, <a href=#
